I am currently a postdoc at [Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute (HDSI)](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/), [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), working with [Dr. Misha Belkin](http://misha.belkin-wang.org/). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/) in 2021, where I was advised by [Dr. Misha Belkin](http://misha.belkin-wang.org/). After that, I spent one year at Meta Platforms Inc., as a research scientist. I also hold B.S. and M.S. degrees in physics from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).

**Research Interests:** My research focuses on the theoretical foundation of deep learning optimization and of its acceleration. I am enthusiastic in theoretically understanding the dynamics of neural network training, and the mechanisms behind. My recent research effort has been devoted to finding fundamental properties of neural networks and/or algorithms that are responsible for the practical fast training. By doing so, we were able to establish optimization theories and develop accelerated algorithms for neural networks. I am also interested in the connections between optimization and generalization performance of neural networks.

**I will join [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), [Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) as an Assistant Professor in August 2024. I am looking for PhD students to join my group. Please email me if you are interested in working with me!**
